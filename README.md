** This instruction assumes that all actions for preparing a usb flash drive will be performed in the 
Windows operating system. **


The whole task is divided into several points, namely:
1) Creating a bootable installation USB flash drive;
2) Installation of the system;
3) Setting up the system;
4) Verification.

First, we need an image of the system that we will install. I chose Xubuntu (the system will be 64-bit). Download the image of the distribution:

Then the software to create a bootable USB flash drive:
